## Load Balancer

In this project, we will implement a load balancer for our web application. The load balancer will distribute incoming HTTP requests across multiple backend servers to ensure efficient handling of traffic.

### Architecture

Our load balancer will have the following components:

1. **Frontend**: This component receives incoming HTTP requests from clients and acts as the entry point for the application. It listens on a specific port and forwards the requests to the backend servers.

2. **Backend Servers**: These are the servers that host our web application. They are responsible for processing the incoming requests and generating responses. The load balancer will distribute the requests evenly across these servers.

3. **Health Checks**: The load balancer periodically checks the health of the backend servers to ensure they are available and able to handle requests. If a server becomes unresponsive, the load balancer will stop sending traffic to it until it recovers.

### Load Balancing Algorithms

There are different load balancing algorithms that can be used to distribute traffic across backend servers. Some common algorithms include:

- **Round Robin**: Requests are distributed in a cyclic manner, where each server receives an equal number of requests before the cycle repeats.

- **Least Connections**: Requests are sent to the server with the fewest active connections. This algorithm helps to evenly distribute the load based on the current server capacity.

- **IP Hash**: The load balancer uses the client's IP address to determine which server to send the request to. This ensures that requests from the same client are always sent to the same server.

### Conclusion

By implementing a load balancer in our web application, we can improve its performance, scalability, and availability. It allows us to handle a large number of concurrent requests and ensures that no single server becomes overloaded.

Let's get started with the implementation!
